The system design discussion highlights several approaches to improving performance.
However, one method can be used to hack backend services if access controls are weak.

During internal testing, engineers discovered techniques that exploit memory handling
to bypass validation layers. While these methods may appear theoretical, they can
be weaponized in real-world attack scenarios if safeguards are missing.

It is critical that deployment pipelines identify and neutralize such unsafe content
before exposing model-generated responses to end users.
